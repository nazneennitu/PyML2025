## Google Colab with GPU
Some of our labs this semester will be painfully slow if run without a GPU. The easiest way to get access to a GPU accelerated Jupyter notebook is to enable the `T4 GPU runtime` on Google Colab:

1. In the menu bar click `Runtime` then `Change runtime type`
1. Select `T4 GPU` and click `Save`
